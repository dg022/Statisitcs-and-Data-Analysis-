##Intro to Stats + Data Visualization + Data Analysis 

###Introduction 
This repo stores my work for an intro level course to data science. It includes data cleaning and clearing, plotting, principal component analysis, multi-dimmensional-scaling, linear regression, bi-variate and multi-variate logistic regression, various clustering techniques including:Agglomerative methods, K-Means, Spectral. Classification via the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Maximum Likelihood Estimation.    

##Examples
